let figures = [25, 35, 36, 40, 42];//Array in JavaScript are zero index, meaning the first element is at index 0.
console.log(figures[0]);// figures[0] accesses the first element of the array, which is 25 in this case.
console.log(figures[figures.length - 2]);// To get the second to last element of the array, we use the formula: arrayName[arrayName.length - 2].
// Figure.length returns the number of elements in the array, which is 5 in this case.
// Since the array is zero-indexed, the last element is at index length - 1, giving us 42
